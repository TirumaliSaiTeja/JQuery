JQuery Syntax

With the JQuery we can select (query) HTML elements and perform
action on them

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
Examples:

$(this).hide() - hides the current element.

$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".
